msgid ""
"In doing so, mynt will <strong>delete</strong> that directory in the "
"process. For example, if the directory <code>my-mynt-site</code> already "

"and initializing your site there."
msgstr ""

#: docs/quickstart/index.html:61
msgid ""
"Now that you have your site initialized, there are two general rules "
"governing how directories and files are handled by mynt."
msgstr ""

#: docs/quickstart/index.html:62
msgid ""
"The first of which being any directory or file who's name begins with an "
"underscore or a period will be ignored. The one exception to this rule "
"being the four special directories that we will talk about shortly. "
"However, do note that you can have ignored directories and files within "
"these four special directories."
msgstr ""

#: docs/quickstart/index.html:63
msgid ""
"The second rule is that outside of the assets and posts directories "
"<em>(two of the four special directories)</em>, all files that "
"<strong>aren't</strong> HTML or XML files are ignored."
msgstr ""

#: docs/quickstart/index.html:65
msgid ""
"This rule is handy if you want to have a README or LICENSE file at the "
"root of your project. Since neither of those files are HTML or XML files,"
" mynt will ignore them."
msgstr ""

#: docs/quickstart/index.html:67
msgid ""
"Now, onto those four special directories. In a mynt site there are four "
"special directories: <code>_assets/</code>, <code>_locales/</code>, "
"<code>_posts/</code>, and <code>_templates/</code>. These four "
"directories are all located at the project root."
msgstr ""

#: docs/quickstart/index.html:70
msgid ""
"The assets directory is where everything that isn't a template lives. CSS"
" files, images, JavaScript libraries, and so on. If you want mynt to "
"recognized a file that <strong>isn't</strong> an HTML or XML file, it has"
" to live somewhere in the assets directory."
msgstr ""

#: docs/quickstart/index.html:72
msgid ""
"One place ignored directories can be useful is in the assets directory. "
"For example, if you are using a CSS preprocessor like SASS, you can put "
"your SASS files in <code>_assets/css/_sass/</code>, have SASS output to "
"<code>_assets/css/</code>, and all of your SASS files will be ignored by "
"mynt."
msgstr ""

#: docs/quickstart/index.html:76
msgid ""
"The locales directory is used for localization. Localization is a bit of "
"a complicated topic to get into here, so just know that this is where "
"your <code>.mo</code> files would live if you were maintaining a site "
"available in multiple languages."
msgstr ""

#: docs/quickstart/index.html:79
msgid ""
"You likely guessed it. The posts directory is where all of your posts "
"will live. There isn't really anything else to say about this directory."
msgstr ""

#: docs/quickstart/index.html:81
msgid ""
"Ignored directories can also be put to use in the posts directory. For "
"example, if you have some post ideas you are working on, but aren't ready"
" to publish them, you can put them in <code>_posts/_drafts/</code> and "
"mynt will ignore them."
msgstr ""

#: docs/quickstart/index.html:85
msgid ""
"Lastly, there's the templates directory. The name of this directory can "
"be a bit confusing for the sole reason that <strong>any</strong> HTML or "
"XML file that isn't in either the assets or posts directories is a "
"template. They will all get passed through the configured renderer "
"<em>(Jinja by default)</em>."
msgstr ""

#: docs/quickstart/index.html:86
msgid ""
"The difference between having a template in the templates directory and "
"somewhere else in your site, is that templates in the templates directory"

"The configuration of mynt is handled by a single file at the root of your"

"One powerful thing about mynt's configuration file, is that "
