    <p>The goal of this guide is to get you up and running quickly with mynt. If after reading this guide you still have questions that aren't answered by the other doc pages or you run into any issues, feel free to open an issue on <a href="https://github.com/Anomareh/mynt/issues">GitHub</a> or hop in <a href="http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=mynt">IRC</a>.</p>
    
    
    {#
     # INSTALLATION
     #}
    <h1 id="installation">Installation</h1>
    <p>The recommended way to install mynt is via <a href="http://www.pip-installer.org/">pip</a>. If you already have pip installed, the below should be all you need. Otherwise, head on over to the pip site to get it <a href="http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/installing.html">installed</a>.</p>
    <pre><code data-lang="text">$ pip install mynt</code></pre>
    <p>After mynt has been installed, simply run the mynt command with the <code>--version</code> flag to confirm everything completed successfully.</p>
    <pre><code data-lang="text">$ mynt --version
mynt {{ site.version }}</code></pre>
    
    
    {#
     # DIRECTORY STRUCTURE
     #}
    <h1 id="directory-structure">Directory structure</h1>
    <p>Let's start off by initializing a new site. This is done with the <code>init</code> subcommand.</p>
    <pre><code data-lang="text">$ mynt init ~/projects/my-mynt-site/</code></pre>
    <div class="notice notice-info">
        <p>Throughout the rest of this guide, the directory you initialized your site in will be referred to as the project root. Given the above usage of <code>init</code>, the project root would be <code>~/projects/my-mynt-site/</code>.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="notice notice-warning">
        <p>If the directory you want to initialize your site in already exists, you will have to pass the <code>-f</code> flag to force initialization.</p>
        <pre><code data-lang="text">$ mynt init -f ~/projects/my-mynt-site/</code></pre>
        <p>In doing so, mynt will <strong>delete</strong> that directory in the process. For example, if the directory <code>my-mynt-site</code> already exists in <code>~/projects/</code>, the above command will <strong>delete</strong> <code>my-mynt-site</code> before recreating it and initializing your site there.</p>
    </div>
    <p>Now that you have your site initialized, there are two general rules governing how directories and files are handled by mynt.</p>
    <p>The first of which being any directory or file who's name begins with an underscore or a period will be ignored. The one exception to this rule being the three special directories that we will talk about shortly. However, do note that you can have ignored directories and files within these three special directories.</p>
    <p>The second rule is that outside of the assets and posts directories <em>(two of the three special directories)</em>, all files that <strong>aren't</strong> HTML or XML files are ignored.</p>
    <dir class="notice notice-info">
        <p>This rule is handy if you want to have a README or LICENSE file at the root of your project. Since neither of those files are HTML or XML files, mynt will ignore them.</p>
    </dir>
    <p>Now, onto those three special directories. In a mynt site there are three special directories: <code>_assets/</code>, <code>_posts/</code>, and <code>_templates/</code>. These three directories are all located at the project root.</p>
    
    <h2 id="directory-structure.the-assets-directory">The assets directory</h2>
    <p>The assets directory is where everything that isn't a template lives. CSS files, images, JavaScript libraries, and so on. If you want mynt to recognized a file that <strong>isn't</strong> an HTML or XML file, it has to live somewhere in the assets directory.</p>
    <div class="notice notice-info">
        <p>One place ignored directories can be useful is in the assets directory. For example, if you are using a CSS preprocessor like SASS, you can put your SASS files in <code>_assets/css/_sass/</code>, have SASS output to <code>_assets/css/</code>, and all of your SASS files will be ignored by mynt.</p>
    </div>
    
    <h2 id="directory-structure.the-posts-directory">The posts directory</h2>
    <p>You likely guessed it. The posts directory is where all of your posts will live. There isn't really anything else to say about this directory.</p>
    <div class="notice notice-info">
        <p>Ignored directories can also be put to use in the posts directory. For example, if you have some post ideas you are working on, but aren't ready to publish them, you can put them in <code>_posts/_drafts/</code> and mynt will ignore them.</p>
    </div>
    
    <h2 id="directory-structure.the-templates-directory">The templates directory</h2>
    <p>Lastly, there's the templates directory. The name of this directory can be a bit confusing for the sole reason that <strong>any</strong> HTML or XML file that isn't in either the assets or posts directories is a template. They will all get passed through the configured renderer <em>(Jinja by default)</em>.</p>
    <p>The difference between having a template in the templates directory and somewhere else in your site, is that templates in the templates directory are not actual pages. They are simply templates that get reused by other templates or are used by mynt internally <em>(like a post's <code>layout</code>)</em>.</p>
    <div class="notice notice-info">
        <p>It may help clear things up if you think of the templates directory as an includes directory.</p>
    </div>
    
    
    {#
     # CONFIGURATION
     #}
    <h1 id="configuration">Configuration</h1>
    <p>The configuration of mynt is handled by a single file at the root of your project: <code>config.yml</code>. If the file doesn't exist a set of defaults will be used, but if you wish to change any settings you'll have to create it. All of the settings are rather straight forward, so I won't go into detail here, but if that's what you're looking for, check out the <a href="{{ get_url('docs/config/') }}">config</a> documentation.</p>
    <p>One powerful thing about mynt's configuration file, is that <strong>everything</strong> in it, mynt setting or not, is made available to templates. This can be taken advantage of in many ways. For example, you could add a title or author attribute and then if you ever need to change that information, all you have to do is update it in your site's config rather than in every template.</p>
    
    
    {#
     # TEMPLATES
     #}
    <h1 id="templates">Templates</h1>
    <p>With your site set up and a general sense of how a mynt site is structured, let's move on to templates.</p>
    <p>In the case of this guide <em>(and also by default)</em> the renderer used is <a href="http://jinja.pocoo.org/">Jinja</a>. If you're not already familiar with Jinja, head on over and give the <a href="http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/templates/">Jinja documentation</a> a quick read.</p>
    <p>For the most part a template in mynt is no different from any other Jinja template. However, there are three things worth mentioning. The first being two mynt specific helper functions and the second as well as the third being the available globals and locals.</p>
    
    <h2 id="templates.helper-functions">Helper functions</h2>
    <p>Two mynt specific helper functions are provided to make retrieving URLs within your site easier. They do this by taking into account how your site is configured. Specifically the <code>assets_url</code>, <code>base_url</code>, and <code>domain</code> settings.</p>
    <p>The first helper function is <code>get_asset()</code>. You should use it whenever you need a URL to anything living in the assets directory. The second helper function is <code>get_url()</code> and it should be used whenever you need a URL to anywhere else in your site.</p>
    <div class="notice notice-info">
        <p>Whenever you need a link internal to your site, you should use these two helper functions. The reason being, if you ever decide to move it, you'll only need to update the relevant configuration settings to update all of the links.</p>
    </div>
    
    <h2 id="templates.globals">Globals</h2>
    <p>Template globals are variables containing site data that are available in every template. There are four template globals: <code>site</code>, <code>posts</code>, <code>archives</code>, and <code>tags</code>.</p>
    <p>The first, <code>site</code>, is simply a dictionary of everything in the site's config file. The other three all contain your site's posts each organized in a different way. First there is <code>posts</code>, which is just a list. Then there is <code>archives</code>, which is a dictionary organized by year and month. Lastly there is <code>tags</code>, which is organized by tag and ordered by post count then name.</p>
    <div class="notice notice-info">
        <p>For a detailed look at the structure of the template globals, check out the <a href="{{ get_url('docs/templates/#data.globals') }}">globals</a> section of the templates documentation.</p>
    </div>
    
    <h2 id="templates.locals">Locals</h2>
    <p>Template locals are very similar to the globals we just discussed with the one exception that they are only available in specific templates. There are three template locals: <code>post</code>, <code>archive</code>, and <code>tag</code>.</p>
    <p>Each local is a specific item of it's respective global that is made available to the template defined by it's respective layout setting.</p>
    <p>For example, <code>post</code> is only available to templates that are used as a post's <code>layout</code> and contains the data of a single post. Similarly, <code>archive</code> is only available to <code>archive_layout</code> and contains the data of a single year of the <code>archives</code> global. And lastly, <code>tag</code> is only available to <code>tag_layout</code> and contains the data of a single tag.</p>
    <div class="notice notice-info">
        <p>For a detailed look at the structure of the template locals, check out the <a href="{{ get_url('docs/templates/#data.locals') }}">locals</a> section of the templates documentation.</p>
    </div>
    
    
    {#
     # POSTS
     #}
    <h1 id="posts">Posts</h1>
    <p>Now with templates out of the way, let's move on to posts.</p>
    <p>The first thing you need to know about posts is that post filenames need to be formatted in a specific way.</p>
    <pre><code data-lang="text">YYYY-MM-DD[-HH-MM]-An-example-post.md</code></pre>
    <p>The hour and minute is optional and if not supplied the hour and minute of when you last edited the post will be used. In the case of having multiple posts on the same day, if you edited them in the order you want them displayed, you don't need to supply the hour and minute.</p>
    <p>Now let's take a look at how posts need to be formatted themselves.</p>
    <p>With the site you've initialized <em>(and by default)</em>, the markup language used in posts is <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>. There are only two things that differentiate a post from an ordinary Markdown document. The first being the YAML frontmatter and the second being the ability to use the features of the configured renderer.</p>
    
    <h2 id="posts.yaml-frontmatter">YAML frontmatter</h2>
    <p>The YAML frontmatter is a block of YAML fenced by three dashes at the start of a post containing post metadata. It looks like the following:</p>
    <pre><code data-lang="YAML">---
layout: post.html
---</code></pre>
    <p>Every post <strong>requires</strong> a YAML frontmater with the <code>layout</code> attribute set. The <code>layout</code> attribute tells mynt which template in the templates directory it should use to render the post.</p>
    <p>The only other attribute that has a special meaning in the YAML frontmatter, though it's <strong>optional</strong>, is <code>tags</code>. The <code>tags</code> attribute is used by the tagging functionality mynt offers which we'll talk about later.</p>
    <p>You are free to add whatever data you want to a post's YAML frontmatter and it will be available in templates when accessing that specific post. A common example of this is using an attribute to store the formatted version of a post's title.</p>
    <div class="notice notice-info">
        <p>There are many ways to make use of the YAML frontmatter. For example, you can implement simple multiple author support by adding an author attribute to every post. Then a specific author's posts can be grabbed by filtering a for loop or using the <code>groupby</code> filter.</p>
        <pre><code data-lang="jinja">{{ "{% for post in posts if post.author == 'Author' %}
    ...
{% endfor %}" }}</code></pre>
        <pre><code data-lang="jinja">{{ "{% for author, posts in posts|groupby('author') %}
    ...
{% endfor %}" }}</code></pre>
    </div>
    
    <h2 id="posts.renderer-functionality">Renderer functionality</h2>
    <p>All of the features of the configured renderer are also available for use in posts with the exception of what data is available. The only template data available to posts is the YAML frontmatter of the post itself and the <code>site</code> template global.</p>
    <pre><code data-lang="jinja">---
layout: post.html
title: An example post.
---

# {{ '{{ title }}' }}

![image]({{ '{{ get_asset(\'images/image.jpg\') }}' }})</code></pre>
    <p>For example, in the above post, Jinja functionality is used to create a header containing the value of the title attribute from the YAML frontmatter as well as a template helper to grab a link to an image.</p>
    
    
    {#
     # TAGGING
     #}
    <h1 id="tagging">Tagging</h1>
    <p>With templates and posts covered, let's move on to how mynt handles tagging.</p>
    <p>To tag a post, simply add the <code>tags</code> attribute to the YAML frontmatter containing a list of the desired tags.</p>
    <pre><code data-lang="text">---
layout: post.html
title: An example post
tags: [Foo, Bar]
---</code></pre>
    <div class="notice notice-warning">
        <p>Tags are <strong>case-sensitive</strong>. <em>"Foo"</em> and <em>"foo"</em> are two different tags.</p>
    </div>
    <p>Once a post has been tagged, this change is reflected in a couple of ways. First, all of a post's tags will be available via a <code>tags</code> attribute. Second, that post will be added to each tag in the <code>tags</code> global.</p>
    
    <h2 id="tagging.automatic-tag-pages">Automatic tag pages</h2>
    <p>If your site has a lot of tagged posts it may be desirable to have a separate page for each tag. One of mynt's key features is the ability to do just that.</p>
    <p>To enable it, <code>tag_layout</code> must be set in your site's config. This setting tells mynt which template in the templates directory to use when rendering these pages. Once it is set, a page will be rendered with that template for each tag.</p>
    
    
    {#
     # ARCHIVES
     #}
    <h1 id="archives">Archives</h1>
    <p>We've gone over posts and tagging so now let's talk about archives.</p>
    <p>For the most part, how you want to handle post archives is up to you. To give you as much flexibility as possible there are the three template globals. Most notably, <code>archives</code>, which is a dictionary of your site's posts organized by year and month.</p>
    <h2 id="archives.automatic-archive-pages">Automatic archive pages</h2>
    <p>Just like with tags, another key feature of mynt is the ability to automatically generate archive pages. If your site has a lot of posts or if you want to provide an alternate more compact way of browsing all of your site's posts, such a feature may be of use to you.</p>
    <p>Enabling this feature is done very much in the same way as enabling automatic tag pages. In your site's config, set <code>archive_layout</code> to the template in the templates directory you want mynt to use when rendering these pages. Doing so, a page will be rendered with that template for each year a post was made.</p>
    
    
    {#
     # GENERATION
     #}
    <h1 id="generation">Generation</h1>
    <p>Now that we have the basics covered, it's time to generate your site.</p>
    <p>Generating a mynt site is handled by two different subcommands: <code>gen</code> and <code>watch</code>. If you just need to make a quick change, <code>gen</code> is best for the job. It will generate your site and then exit.</p>
    <pre><code data-lang="text">$ mynt gen &lt;source&gt; &lt;destination&gt;</code></pre>
    <p>If you're going to be making a bunch of changes to your site, constantly reusing <code>gen</code> will quickly become a hassle. Instead you can use the <code>watch</code> subcommand.</p>
    <pre><code data-lang="text">$ mynt watch &lt;source&gt; &lt;destination&gt;</code></pre>
    <p>For the most part it is identical to <code>gen</code>. However, there is one major difference: Every time you make a change to your site, it will be automatically regenerated for you.</p>
    <div class="notice notice-warning">
        <p>When using either subcommand, if the destination already exists, you will have to pass the <code>-f</code> flag to force generation.</p>
        <pre><code data-lang="text">$ mynt {gen,watch} -f &lt;source&gt; &lt;destination&gt;</code></pre>
        <p>In doing so, mynt will <strong>delete</strong> any directory or file at the root of the destination that doesn't begin with an underscore or period.</p>
    </div>
    <p>Now that you've generated your site, I'm sure you want to check it out and see the fruits of your efforts. If you have a local server setup you're good to go, but if you don't, mynt's got you covered. The last subcommand we're going to talk about is <code>serve</code>.</p>
    <pre><code data-lang="text">$ mynt serve &lt;source&gt;</code></pre>
    <div class="notice notice-error">
        <p>This subcommand should not be used to publicly host your site. It should only be used for local development and testing.</p>
    </div>
    <p>To start up the server pass the directory containing your generated site to the <code>serve</code> subcommand. Then, to view your site simply browse to <a href="http://localhost:8080/">http://localhost:8080/</a>.</p>
    <div class="notice notice-info">
        <p>For a more detailed look at the commands mynt provides, check out the <a href="{{ get_url('docs/command-line/') }}">command line</a> documentation.</p>
    </div>
    <p>Once you're happy with your site, you're good to upload it to whichever host you wish, whether that be <a href="https://pages.github.com">GitHub Pages</a> or your own VPS.</p>
