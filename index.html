            If you're looking to get up and running quickly, give the <a href="{{ quickstart }}">quickstart</a> guide a read. Otherwise, if you're familiar with static site generators, the other, more reference style doc pages may be a better jumping off point for you. You can also check out the <a href="{{ sites }}">sites</a> page and check out the sites who's sources are available if you prefer working off of examples.
